<h4>Extra, Extra, This Just In!</h4>

DOMtempl can now help you achieve whitespace nirvana. Whether you're an XML pedant
or a ident hater, it will accomodate your whitespace styling automagically and will
replicate it faithfully.

I'm 99% sure no string-based templating engine is even remotely capable of such 
behavior. The hack is very elegant and is only possible with DOM templating.

<h4>Python and Node.js ports available</h4>
That's right. Check out the documentation section.

<h2>Why</h2>

<p>Because going into templates/default/articles/post/pages.php to find 2 lines of
templating / HTML soup is maddening. </p>

<p>Because needing a full back-end to see one CSS change is angering.</p>

<p>Because having a template that is not HTML and thus robs you of your 
favourite developer tools is suffering.</p>

<h2>And so</h2>

<p>By misunderstanding ideas of XSLT, abusing HTML5 custom attributes, and leveraging the
all-powerfull DOM, comes templating library that brings you the peace of mind.</p>

<p>It is a work in progess, so if you find something that is maddening, angering
or leads to suffering, please make sure to have a say.</p>

<p>GitHub repo</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/makesite/domtempl.git
</code></pre>

<p>Take a look at the joyfull <a href="samples.html">samples</a> page and a boring
<a href="docs_main.html">documenation</a> section.</p>

<h2>Why not</h2>

<ul>
<li>Templates can get rather big, whole template is parsed each time</li>
<li>You can't include templates into each other</li>
<li>You can't alter text elements, only HTML elements are alterable</li>
</ul>

<p>DOM parsing is rather fast (and should only get faster), but can
be memory-expesnive at the same time.</p>

<p>Breaking the template down to multiple files is considered evil inside
temple walls, and shall not be discussed here. You can probably achieve
what you desire by assigning the output of FRAGMENT parsing onto another
template, but you're on your own here.</p>

<p>Third problem is best described like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;?= $a ?&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;?= $b ?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;?= $c ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Is a pretty common construct, which <em>is not</em> possible in DOMtempl. Several
workarounds are possible, i.e wrapping $a and $c into their own html elements,
or generating html by hand and setting it to div element; both are not
ideal. It could be argued, however, that stand-alone text elements should
not exist from semantic point of view at all.</p>

<p>Lastly, you can't have advanced scripting in your templates. That is by design,
but could become problematic in some cases.</p>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>Two-clause BSD.</p>

<h2>P.S.</h2>

<p>While pondering a python port, it came to my attention, that DOM-based templating
is prevalent there, unlike the world of PHP. Several interesting projects
<a href="http://plope.com/Members/chrism/dom_templating">exist</a>, so you should probably use one of them.</p>
